# PLEASE READ

**Am i an IRL?**

No. I'm not. I only kin Sonic and other characters. I do NOT support IRLs in anyways. Stop associating me w them. I'd rather be called a Sonic kinnie than a Sonic IRL. 

#

**The reason to why i have **IRLSONIC** as a user**

I wanted to name myself as "**KINSONIC**" before fully changing myself as **IRLSONIC**, but the name sounded dumb. So i asked one of my friends to help me choose a name for myself.

I do NOT support IRLs in any ways and i KNOW they are ableist. I only kin Sonic, nothing more.

#

**I won't change my user as i'm known as **IRLSONIC** by basically everyone... SO STOP SAYING I AM AN IRL, BC IM NOT.**
